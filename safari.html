       <br> Bardia National Park is equally rich in biodiversity and is less populated than Chitwan National Park. 
       This protected area extending over 968 sq km is a dreamland for wildlife enthusiasts and a favorable habitat for the Royal Bengal Tigers. 
       Tracking and watching the majestic endangered creature has become one of the popular activities in this national park.
        Besides tigers, other rare and endangered animals like the one-horned rhinos and Asian elephants also reside in the jungles of Bardia. 
        Similarly, more than 438 species of resident and migratory birds hover around the forests, grasslands, and river banks. While the Gharial crocodiles, river dolphins, and 125 species of fish are found in Karnali and Babai Rivers nearby.
